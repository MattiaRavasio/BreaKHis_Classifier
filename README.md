# BreaKHis_Classifier

This is the project for my bachelor thesis, called "a deep learning approach to breast cancer classification". 

The project leverages the use of a benchamrk dataset, called BreaKHis, and proposes a novel CAD system for cacner classification. 
The proposed model was trained with the help of data augmentation, L2 regularization and dataset balancing. 
It reached a 98.02% in accuracy, which is up to date the highest reported in the literature
